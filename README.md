# Automatic-Precipitation-Detection-For-Vehicles
This project is about an automatic precipitation detection for car made using an Arduino Uno, Rain Sensor, LDR and LED.   This project is designed to build a car wiper that automatically detects the rainfall intensity and regulates the frequency of wiper operation. It is built, using Arduino UNO board. A rain sensing module is used for measuring the intensity of rainfall. And a servo motor is used for controlling the wiper movements. An LCD module is also attached to the controller for displaying the rainfall intensity. By measuring the amount of rainfall, controller will adjust the speed of servo motor. Servo is controlled by generating PWM signal at its signal line.
